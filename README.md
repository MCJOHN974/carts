It's a simple algorithm implemented in C++ with intentionally heavy
usages of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

As an input, there are four geometric shapes, like a circle, an oval, a square,
and a rectangle. Each shape has its own size parameters, which are encapsulated
and can't be retrieved. The algorithm has to find the best allocation of
the given shapes in 2x2 space.
